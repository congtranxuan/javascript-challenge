3. The user just input the date to filter the data from **data.js**.

### Level 2:
4. In level 2, we will have more condition to filter the date, we use both the input and dropdown menu to choose the items.
5. Generally, the data will not come up if no condition filled in, it means that at least one condition have to put in to filter the data.

6. In the **app.js**, we read condition inputs from html and dropdown menu into, every time the user click on **FilterTable** button, it gets the conditions and clear the input spaces.
